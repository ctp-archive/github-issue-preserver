  <p>From March 7, 2020 to April 12, 2021, the COVID Tracking Project maintained a <a href="https://github.com/COVID19Tracking/issues">public issue tracker</a> for members of the public and project volunteers to submit problems with data found on our website. This is an archive of the issues, comments, and file attachments of that issue tracker. You can also <a href="download.html">download this data as JSON files</a>.</p>
